    <p>I'm Andrew Dawson, a software developer and artist from Richmond, Va. I've long been interested in experimental and art games, and interactive art tools.</p>

    <p>Visual art was my main pursuit before programming. I posted abstract art, short music pieces, and photography on an old <a href="https://vavassor.tumblr.com/">Tumblr blog</a> that is now closed. I started getting into code through independent game development and made a few short games and more unfinished ones. A bit of time was also spent making custom game engines.</p>

    <p>I've recently shifted my focus to web development. It's pretty neato!</p>
